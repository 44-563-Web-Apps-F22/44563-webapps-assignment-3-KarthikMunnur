    <h1 style="color:khaki;"> Mount Vernon MILES</h1>
    <p>
        Miles was developed in the early 1990s and made his first public appearance at the 1995 Pro Bowl[3] as a Team NFL Hero. Team NFL Heroes were a line of mascot-like characters created by NFL Properties for every team in the league; most of the characters only lasted a season or two but a handful ended up being adopted as official mascots by their respective teams, either immediately after the Team NFL Heroes project was canceled or years later with Miles being an example of the latter. Before the Broncos unveiled him as their official team mascot some changes to his appearance were made, such as changing his fur from orange to white and switching his jersey number from 0 to 00.

            <li>Miles loves his new home, and the turf management folks appreciate the help he provides keeping the turf nicely trimmed.</li>
            <li>The horses were, not surprisingly, huge Broncos fans.</li>
            <li>They taught Miles all about the great Broncos traditions and the great players who had carried the team to numerous wins and two world championships.</li>
